Demonized is the freeware version of a font named "Blue Demon" that
I originally made for DePaul University. It's a long story, but I'll
give you the condensed version to explain why I am distributing an
improved version of the font for free.

Back in 1999, I was contacted by DePaul University to see what I
would charge them to make a true type font for them. I told them, as
you might expect, it would be $0.00, as are all of my fonts. They
were pleasantly shocked and took me up on my offer. Several months,
and many e-mails (some answered, some not) later, I finally was able
to get enough information from them to created the "Blue Demon" font.
After they supplied several defective EPS files (which would not open),
I gave up and created the font from scratch.

In November of 1999, I completed a "beta" version of the font and
e-mailed it to them for their evaluation of the characters, spacing,
etc. In spite of repeated e-mail inquiries throughout 2000, I have
yet to ever receive a reply as to whether the font was acceptable.
No "Thanks, it's just what we wanted." No "Your font sucks, take a
hike bozo!" No nuthin'! I've been "Demonized" and now you can be too!

"Go [insert your college team here]!!  Beat the Blue Demons!!"

And, if your from DePaul and want to know who so poorly represents
your university with outside vendors, I have names, dates and all
pertinent correspondence.
